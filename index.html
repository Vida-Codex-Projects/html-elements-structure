            <h2>Adopt Your Companion</h2>
            <p>The Pound Puppy Extravaganza will feature a wide variety of adoptable dogs to suit every lifestyle and preference. From playful puppies eager to grow up in a loving home to calm and loyal senior dogs looking for a peaceful retirement, there is a perfect match for everyone. You'll meet small breeds ideal for apartment living, medium-sized companions perfect for active families, and large, lovable gentle giants ready to become your new best friend. Many of the dogs are mixed breeds with unique personalities, and all have been vet-checked, vaccinated, and temperament-tested by participating shelters. Whether you're a first-time dog owner or an experienced pup parent, you're sure to find a four-legged friend ready to make your heart their home.</p><br>

            <h2>Adoption Qualifications</h2>
            <p>To ensure the best match for both pets and families, all potential adopters must meet basic adoption qualifications. This includes being at least 21 years old, providing a valid photo ID, and showing proof of residence. If you rent your home, a letter of permission from your landlord is required. A brief screening process will be conducted on-site to assess compatibility and ensure a safe, loving environment for each dog. Some shelters may also request a home visit or veterinary references before finalizing the adoption. Please come prepared and patient as we work together to find the right forever home for every pup!</p><br>
